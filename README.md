# AMP

Design and implement an algorithm to process an RGB image from the ZED camera, and output three control values (range of 0-255):
- Throttle
- Steering
- Braking


threshTuning.py - chainging hsv values to threshold an image and print contours/midpoint

midpoint_test.py - running hsv threshing and contour detection on a ros subscriber, **doesn't work**
